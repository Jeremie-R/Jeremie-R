            <h1>Designing Payments for the Creator Economy</h1>
            <p>Gigapay connects brands and agencies with creators and influencers, making it simple to handle payments. The platform consolidates invoices, manages KYC onboarding, ensures compliance with EU law, and even offers financing options for faster payouts. The challenge was to make this system user-friendly for creators while reliable for procurement teams. As an early-stage startup, Gigapay needed both a strong product foundation and a cohesive brand identity.</p>

        <h2>Building a Design System from Scratch</h2>
        <p>As the first designer at Gigapay, I stepped into a company without any design infrastructure. I set out to create a scalable foundation that would support both the product and the brand. This meant working closely with the founders and marketing team to define a consistent visual identity, while at the same time collaborating with the lead front-end developer to ensure every component was reliable, accessible, and WCAG-compliant. Beyond just building the system, I also documented it thoroughly so that future designers and developers could immediately understand how components were meant to be used and adapted.</p>

        <h2>Balancing Speed with Identity</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenge was designing while rebuilding at the same time. The old product still needed urgent UX fixes, while the new design system had to be built in parallel.</br> This meant: </br>
_ Maintaining the old experience while preparing the new one to replace it. </br>
_ Navigating the tension between fast delivery and building a long-term identity. </br>
_ Ensuring accessibility in every decision, even when external libraries weren't compliant. </br>
_ Making sure the system could communicate reliability while still feeling modern and appealing to creators.</p>

            <p class="dark">One of his major contributions was building out our entire UI library. He approached it with such care, professionalism, and an incredible eye for detail, creating something that was not only beautiful but also super practical and scalable. [...]. What I also really admired about Jeremie was how he'd always go the extra mile to connect with our customers. He was proactive in seeking out their feedback and insights, [...]. As a developer, I also truly appreciated how collaborative he was ; he made sure his designs were not just user-centric but also practical to build.</p>

        <h2>A System That Scales with the Product</h2>
        <p>The new design system gave Gigapay a flexible foundation to grow, making redesigns faster, new features easier to launch, and accessibility standards consistently met. Because it was well-documented, developers and future designers could work with it smoothly, reducing friction across the team.

I learned that the most valuable systems are built for real use first and expanded later. Flexibility is essential for long-term success, and close collaboration with developers is key since technology choices directly shape design quality.</p>
